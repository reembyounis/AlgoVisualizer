# AlgoVisualizer

## Description
AlgoVisualizer is a tool developed using Unity to convey a visual illustration of algorithm's operation. AlgoVisualizer contains 3 different pathfinding algorithms: A*,DFS,BFS. In addition, in contains 4 different sorting algorithms: bubble sort,insertion sort,heap sort, quick sort.
Our mission is to implement all useful algorithms, so AlgoVisualizer would contain helpful illustration of those algorithms.

## Implementation details
AlgoVisualizer is developed using Unity and written with c#. UI design was hardcoded and useful buttons were added.
