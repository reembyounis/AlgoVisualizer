# AlgoVisualizer

## Description
AlgoVisualizer is a tool developed using Unity to convey a visual illustration of algorithm's operation. AlgoVisualizer contains 3 different pathfinding algorithms: A*,DFS,BFS. In addition, in contains 4 different sorting algorithms: bubble sort,insertion sort,heap sort, quick sort.
Our mission is to implement all useful algorithms, so AlgoVisualizer would contain helpful illustration of those algorithms.

## Implementation details
AlgoVisualizer is developed using Unity and written with c#. UI design was hardcoded and useful buttons were added.

Week 1:
- Reading about commonly used pathfinding methods.
- Starting to get familiar with unity and c#.

Week 2:
- Prepared material on A* and Dijkestra's methods.
- Continued practicing on unity and done some simple things like colliding 2 object, using rigidbody, creating grid, etc.

Week 3:
- Creating repository.
- Started writing A* script in a simple way to see how the user could interact with it.

Week 4:
- Done writing simple A* and visualizing it in 3D.

Week 5:
- Adding colors to the scene to see.
(haven't had a good progress this week).

Week 6:
some updates on adding obsatcles:
- left click on mouse to add obstacle.
- space to see the path.

Week 7:
- adding menu.
- adding options, such as random maze.

Week 8:
- while playing, click escp to pause.

week 9:
- no progress due to other obligations

week 10: 
- added bfs, dfs, dijkstra algorithms.

week 11-14:
- no progress due to final exams.

week 15:
- added sorting algorithms.
- menus

week 16:
- continued adding sorting algorithms.

week 17-19: 
- no progress.

week 20-june:
- designed UI
- added algorithms
- finished project
